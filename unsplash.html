   <button class="accordion">ABOUT MUSIC</button>
    <div class="panel">
   <p>Music is an art form, and cultural activity, whose medium is sound. General definitions of
      music include common elements such as pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its 
      associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic 
      qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different
       styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed 
       with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely
        instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. </p>

  <p>Technology Is the sum of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods
     or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can
      be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow 
      for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings. Systems (e.g. machines) applying technology
       by taking an input, changing it according to the system's use, and then producing an outcome are
        referred to as technology systems or technological systems.</p>

  <button class="accordion">ABOUT SPORTS</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Sport includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games which,
     through casual or organized participation, at least in part aim to use, maintain or 
     improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in
      some cases, entertainment for spectators.[2] Sports can bring positive results to
       one's physical health. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants,
        through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing
        as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, 
        simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a match) is between 
    two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. </p>

  <button class="accordion">ABOUT NATURE</button>
   <div class="panel">
  <p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or universe. Nature can refer to the phenomena of the physical 
    world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, 
    human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena. </p>
